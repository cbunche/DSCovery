# DSCovery

DSCovery is a tool to find civic tech jobs with [Digital Services Coalition](http://digitalservicescoalition.org) firms. This is very much a work in progress, and I make no promises of stability.

You can see it live at https://dscovery.fly.dev

Additional importers will be added as there is demand, and pull requests are welcomed.

We will also add DSC-adjacent firms, if they're good folks in the civic tech space.
