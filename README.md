# DSCovery

DSCovery is a tool to find civic tech jobs with [Digital Services Coalition](http://digitalservicescoalition.org) firms. This is very much a work in progress, and I make no promises of stability.

To run it, you'll need to pull the repo and run it as a Django app. At least until I deploy it. That should be soon. 

It currently collects and aggregates jobs from the following companies:

1. 540
2. Ad Hoc
3. Agile Six
3. Analytica
4. Acquia
5. Archesys
6. AWL (All Women Leadership)
7. Bixal
8. Bloom Works
9. BlueLabs
10. Bracari
11. Capital Technology Group
12. Civic Actions
13. Clarity Innovations
14. Coforma
15. Corbalt
16. Exygy
17. Fearless
18. Metrostrar
19. MO Studio
20. Nava
21. Oddball
22. Pluribus Digital
23. Raft
24. Simple
25. Softrams
26. Skylight
27. Skyward
28. Truss
29. Verdance

It does *not* currently import from these companies:
- Blue Tiger (no current openings)
- Coa (no current openings)
- Cognitive (uses ADP, a pretty awful system, and I haven't yet brought myself to write an importer for it)
- Element (need to write an importer)
- Flexion (no silkroad importer yet)
- Focus (no wellfound importer yet)
- For People (no current openings)
- Friends from the City (no current openings)
- Kind (no current openings)
- Mediabarn (I honestly can't figure out where they post jobs)
- Mobomo (No applytojob importer yet)
- Simon (No applicantpro importer yet)
- Snowbird (I honestly can't figure out where they post jobs)
- Valiant Solutions (No icims importer yet)
- Wheelhouse (bought by cadmus so status unknown)

Additional importers will be added as there is demand, and pull requests are welcomed.

I may also add DSC-adjacent firms, if they're good folks in the civic tech space.
